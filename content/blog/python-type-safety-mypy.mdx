# The Evolution of Python: Embracing Type Safety with mypy

Python has long been known for its simplicity and readability, but as projects grow larger and more complex, the need for better type safety becomes apparent. Enter \`mypy\`, a static type checker that brings optional static typing to Python.

## Why Type Safety Matters

Type safety helps catch errors early in development, improves code maintainability, and provides better documentation. Here's a simple example:

\`\`\`python
def get_user_age(name: str) -> int:
    # Implementation here
    return 25

# This will raise a type error
age = get_user_age(123)  # Expected str, got int
\`\`\`

## Getting Started with mypy

First, install mypy using pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install mypy
\`\`\`

Then, add type hints to your Python code and run mypy:

\`\`\`python
from typing import List, Dict

def process_users(users: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> int:
    return len(users)

# Run mypy
# mypy your_file.py
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. Start with critical code paths
2. Use type aliases for complex types
3. Leverage Python's built-in typing module
4. Enable strict mode for maximum benefits

## Conclusion

Type safety with mypy brings the best of both worlds: Python's simplicity and the safety of static typing. Give it a try in your next project!
